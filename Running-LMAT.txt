The Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT) contains tons of handy features.
You can (1) Assign Taxonomic labels to reads 
    	(2) Assign gene identifiers to reads to input into MEGAN, KEGG, etc. 
	and (3) Generate content (tax/gene) summaries to put in MEGAN or R 

Here's the order of scripts to use:
0. Optional: filter your data if not already filtered. We used https://github.com/ghedin-lab/human-16s-phix-filter
1. seqtk.sh --- LMAT-preprocessing
2. lmat.sh --- LMAT taxonomic labels
2a. Move files from $file.lmat subdirectories into one directory
3. lmat-sumlist.sh --- create lists of fastsummary files for each sample
4. lmat-list.ids.sh --- list taxids of interest (eg. for each genera or kingdom)
4a. Renamed all files to get rid of "non-rRNA.deconseq_clean.mask.fasta.kML+Human.v4-14.20.g10.db."
5. lmat-out-flst.sh --- generate list of .out files for each sample
6. lmat-pull_rank.sh --- pulls all reads for a given taxid list and generates a fasta file
7. --- python script to pull reads of interest from paired fastq files
8. Now you have reads subsetted by genera (or whichever rank) to use for downstream analysis (like assembly)

Prior to LMAT, our files were filtered for contaminating human, rRNA, and phix reads using SortMeRNA and DeconSeq.
For LMAT, we used interleaved filtered .fasta files masked for low quality reads, which requires some conversion using seqtk.

Use the seqtk.sh script to:
    convert interleaved fastq files to fasta and mask low quality reads

Then, you can use lmat.sh to perform the first LMAT analysis: assignment of taxonomic labels.
