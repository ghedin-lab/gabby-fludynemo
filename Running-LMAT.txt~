The Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT) contains tons of handy features.
You can (1) Assign Taxonomic labels to reads 
    	(2) Assign gene identifiers to reads to input into MEGAN, KEGG, etc. 
	and (3) Generate content (tax/gene) summaries to put in MEGAN or R 

Prior to LMAT, our files were filtered for contaminating human, rRNA, and phix reads using SortMeRNA and DeconSeq.
For LMAT, we used interleaved filtered .fasta files masked for low quality reads, which requires some conversion using seqtk.

Use the seqtk.sh script to:
    convert interleaved fastq files to fasta and mask low quality reads

Then, you can use lmat.sh to perform the first LMAT analysis: assignment of taxonomic labels.
